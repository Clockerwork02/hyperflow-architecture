# HyperFlow Protocol - Technical Architecture

## Architecture Overview

HyperFlow Protocol is built as a modular, scalable DeFi infrastructure platform specifically designed to leverage HyperEVM's unique dual-execution environment. The architecture combines traditional EVM compatibility with native HyperCore orderbook integration through precompiles, enabling advanced trading strategies unavailable on other platforms.

## Core Components

### 1. Smart Vault System
The heart of HyperFlow's yield optimization infrastructure, featuring automated strategy execution and risk management.

#### Vault Controller Contract
```solidity
contract HyperFlowVaultController {
    struct VaultStrategy {
        uint256 allocation;      // Percentage allocation
        uint256 riskScore;       // Risk assessment (1-100)
        uint256 expectedAPY;     // Target annual yield
        uint256 lastRebalance;   // Timestamp of last rebalancing
        bool isActive;           // Strategy status
    }
    
    mapping(address => VaultStrategy[]) public userStrategies;
    mapping(address => uint256) public totalDeposits;
    
    function optimizeYield(address user) external {
        // Automated rebalancing logic
        // Risk assessment algorithms
        // Compound reward harvesting
        // Cross-protocol optimization
    }
    
    function emergencyWithdraw(address user) external {
        // Emergency liquidation mechanism
        // Asset protection during market volatility
    }
}
```

### 2. HyperCore Integration Layer
Direct integration with HyperCore orderbook through HyperEVM precompiles, enabling sophisticated arbitrage and delta-neutral strategies.

#### Precompile Interface
```solidity
interface IHyperCorePrecompile {
    // Orderbook data access
    function getOrderbookDepth(address market) 
        external view returns (uint256 bidDepth, uint256 askDepth);
    
    // Direct orderbook execution
    function executeMarketOrder(bytes calldata orderParams) external;
    
    // Delta-neutral position management
    function getBestNeutralPosition(address asset) 
        external view returns (uint256 perpSize, uint256 spotSize);
    
    // Arbitrage opportunity detection
    function findArbitrageOpportunities(address[] calldata markets)
        external view returns (bytes memory opportunities);
}
```

### 3. Cross-DEX Aggregation Engine
Intelligent routing system that aggregates liquidity across all major HyperEVM DEXs for optimal execution.

#### Liquidity Aggregator
```solidity
contract HyperFlowAggregator {
    // Supported DEX protocols
    enum DEXProtocol { HyperSwap, HyperBloom, HyperCore, UniV3 }
    
    struct RouteStep {
        DEXProtocol protocol;
        address pool;
        uint256 amountIn;
        uint256 expectedOut;
        uint256 slippageTolerance;
    }
    
    function findOptimalRoute(
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut,
        uint256 amountIn
    ) external view returns (RouteStep[] memory route) {
        // Multi-DEX routing algorithm
        // Gas optimization calculations
        // MEV protection mechanisms
        // Slippage minimization
    }
    
    function executeOptimalSwap(RouteStep[] calldata route) external {
        // Multi-hop execution with MEV protection
        // Atomic transaction guarantees
        // Front-running prevention
    }
}
```

### 4. Risk Management Framework
Comprehensive risk assessment and protection mechanisms for user funds and protocol stability.

#### Risk Assessment Engine
```solidity
contract RiskManager {
    struct RiskMetrics {
        uint256 volatilityScore;    // Asset volatility rating
        uint256 liquidityDepth;    // Available liquidity
        uint256 correlationRisk;   // Portfolio correlation
        uint256 concentrationRisk; // Position concentration
    }
    
    function assessPortfolioRisk(address user) 
        external view returns (RiskMetrics memory metrics) {
        // Real-time portfolio analysis
        // Correlation matrix calculations
        // Concentration risk assessment
    }
    
    function liquidationPreventionAlert(address user) 
        external view returns (bool atRisk, uint256 timeToLiquidation) {
        // Predictive liquidation analysis
        // Early warning system
    }
}
```

        address asset,
        uint256 notionalAmount
    ) external {
        // Step 1: Calculate optimal hedge ratio
        uint256 hedgeRatio = calculateOptimalHedge(asset);
        
        // Step 2: Open spot position on EVM side
        uint256 spotAmount = notionalAmount;
        openSpotPosition(asset, spotAmount);
        
        // Step 3: Open opposite perpetual position on HyperCore
        uint256 perpAmount = (spotAmount * hedgeRatio) / 1e18;
        openPerpPosition(asset, perpAmount, false); // Short
        
        // Step 4: Monitor and rebalance automatically
